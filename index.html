				Welcome to my page! The name <strong>astroginz</strong> is a reflection of my love for science and technology, as well as a tribute to my very first pet, a guinea pig named Ginz. After 25 years in the corporate world, I’ve decided to embrace a new challenge: stepping into the world of web development. This page is the starting point of that exciting new journey and also happens to be my very first creation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. Thanks for stopping by!

			<h2>Welcome to My Slice of Zurich</h2>
			
			<p> 
				I feel incredibly lucky to call Switzerland home, especially in the beautiful city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zurich</a>. My apartment is just a stone's throw from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Zurich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake Zurich</a>, a spot that has become a part of my daily routine. I love starting my mornings with a peaceful stroll along the water, often taking a moment to snap a photo and soak in the tranquility.

			<h2>A Passion for Photography</h2>
			
			<h3>Nature</h3>
			<p>
				I enjoy capturing moments with my phone, and this summer was especially memorable with the chance to meet a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_swan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mother swan</a> and her four cygnets on the lake near my home. Watching them glide across the water was a joy, and their quiet grace inspired me to document their story through photographs.</p>

				<h3>Local Festivals</h3>
				<p>
					Every autumn, I look forward to Switzerland’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almabtrieb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpabzug</a>, when cows return from their summer pastures in the alpine mountains. Seeing them decorated with colorful flower crowns and bells as they pass through quiet villages is a reminder of the simpler, joyful traditions that make life here so special.

				<h3>Street Art</h3>
				<p>
					One of my favorite street artists is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invader_(artist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invader</a>. I love stumbling across his mosaics here in Switzerland. Invader, a French artist, is known for his tile creations inspired by 8-bit video games, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Invaders</a>. Since the 1990s, his colorful pieces have appeared on walls and public spaces around the world. It’s always a fun surprise to spot one and adds a bit of adventure to my day.

							I’ve been a regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> user for over a decade. The platform’s principles of peer collaboration, built on constructive dissent and mutual respect, deeply resonate with me. In the spirit of open and accessible knowledge, I aim to contribute in my own small way to making information verifiable and available to all.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							With a background in STEM, I’m naturally curious about the “why” and “how” of things. Lately, I’ve been exploring topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">algorithmic biases</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethics of artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">behavioral science</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renewable energy</a>, and sharpening my skills in editing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web development</a>.
