				Welcome to my page! The name <strong>astroginz</strong> reflects my interests in science and technology, and it’s also a nod to my very first pet, a guinea pig named Ginz. After 25 years in the corporate world, I’ve decided to step out of my comfort zone, try something completely new, and learn web development. This page marks the starting point of my adventure and is my very first webpage on GitHub. Thanks for stopping by!

			<h2>Welcome to My Slice of Zurich</h2>
			
			<p>
				I feel very fortunate to call Switzerland home, and even more so to live in the beautiful city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zurich</a>. My apartment is just a five-minute stroll from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Zurich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake Zurich</a>, a place that holds a special spot in my daily routine. I love starting my mornings with a peaceful stroll along the water, sometimes pausing to take a little photo.

			<h2>A Passion for Photography</h2>
			
			<h3>Nature</h3>
			<p>
				I enjoy capturing moments with my phone, and this summer was especially memorable with the chance to meet a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_swan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mother swan</a> and her four cygnets on the lake in my neighborhood.  They are absolutely adorable! Their grace and charm inspired me to document their story through photographs.</p>

				<h3>Local Festivals</h3>
				<p>
					Every autumn, I enjoy being part of Switzerland’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almabtrieb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpabzug</a>, when cows return from their summer pastures in the alpine mountains. Watching them, adorned with colorful flower crowns and bells, as they pass through quiet, out-of-the-way villages feels like a celebration of life’s simple pleasures.

				<h3>Street Art</h3>
				<p>
					One of my favorite street artists is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invader_(artist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invader</a>, and I love spotting his mosaics here in Switzerland. Invader, a French artist, is famous for his mosaic tile creations inspired by 8-bit video game characters, especially Space Invaders. Since the 1990s, his colorful works have popped up on walls and public spaces around the world. It's always exciting to spot one.

				<h2>Doing My Small Part for Open Knowledge</h2>

							I’ve been a regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> user for over a decade. The platform’s principles of peer collaboration, built on constructive dissent and mutual respect, deeply resonate with me. In the spirit of open and accessible knowledge, I aim to contribute in my own small way to making information verifiable and available to all.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							With a background in STEM, I’m naturally curious about the “why” and “how” of things. Lately, I’ve been exploring topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">algorithmic biases</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethics of artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">behavioral science</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renewable energy</a>, and sharpening my skills in editing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web development</a>.
